to run, type "python quad_reg.py"

This runs the polynomial regression with degree (or order) set to 4.
To change this order, go to the bottom of "quad_reg.py" and change the parameter to the function


The RMSE for quadratic regression with order = 2 is: 267.741120655
The RMSE for quadratic regression with order = 3 is: 294.904854136
The RMSE for quadratic regression with order = 4 is: 250.177665511
The RMSE for quadratic regression with order = 5 is: 446.388899503
The RMSE for quadratic regression with order = 6 is: 812.418975318

Order = 4 was chosen because it results in the lowest RMSE
